# Binary to Decimal Converter

A beginner-friendly Python tool that converts binary numbers (including fractional binaries) to decimal.

Features
- Convert integer binary (e.g. `101` -> `5`)
- Convert fractional binary (e.g. `10.11` -> `2.75`)
- Support for negative values (e.g. `-101` -> `-5`)
- Optional detailed, step-by-step explanation of the conversion

How to run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script directly from the repository root:

```powershell
python src/sapekshpareek-create-a-binary-to-decimal-converter/main.py --bin 10.11 --steps
```

Or simply run without arguments to enter an interactive prompt:

```powershell
python src/sapekshpareek-create-a-binary-to-decimal-converter/main.py
```

Examples

- `101` -> `5`
- `10.11` -> `2.75`
- `-101` -> `-5`

Notes
- This project is intentionally dependency-free (no external libraries required). If you add third-party packages later, add them to `requirements.txt`.
